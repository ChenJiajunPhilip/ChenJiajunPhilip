Hello! I am Philip, an NUS penultimate year undergraduate with a major in Quantitative Finance with a second major in Computer Science and minor in Mathematics.  \
I am familiar with Python and also have some experience working with Java and C++. Check out my project on Conway's Game of Life [here](https://github.com/ChenJiajunPhilip/Conway-s-Game-of-Life-with-Python). \

I worked as a Machine Learning Intern at the Institute of High Performance Computing in summer of 2025, where, using Python, I worked with neural networks (DNN, LSTM) and time series machine learning models such as ARIMA. \
